Data Preparation
================

Notebooks to generate processed data needed for the benchmarks. These
should produce e.g. DL1, DL2, or DL3 data products that are
subsequently loaded by the benchmark notebooks in `Benchmarks/`.  The
output data files *should not be included in this git repository*,
only the code necessary to generate them.  All outputs should be
stored in a dedicated storage directory on the machine executing the
notebooks.
